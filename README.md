# Nebulis Coding Analytics Platform &middot; ![TravisCI Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/NebulisAnalytics/nebulis-endpoint.svg)

Nebulis provides realtime analytics and reporting for coding projects. With Nebulis you can embed an endpoint into your coding units so that you can gather code changes to a project fork. Nebulis is set up to be close to zero configuration, so as soon as the endpoint is launched on a fork, that user will be instantly registered into the system and attached to the associated project.

## Installation
---

```
npm install --save nebulis-endpoint
```
