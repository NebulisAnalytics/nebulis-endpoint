# Nebulis Coding Analytics Endpoint &middot; ![TravisCI Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/NebulisAnalytics/nebulis-endpoint.svg) [![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/NebulisAnalytics/nebulis-endpoint/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://coveralls.io/github/NebulisAnalytics/nebulis-endpoint?branch=master) [![Known Vulnerabilities](https://snyk.io/test/github/NebulisAnalytics/nebulis-endpoint/badge.svg)](https://snyk.io/test/github/NebulisAnalytics/nebulis-endpoint)

This is the endpoint for tracking Nebulis coding projects.

Nebulis provides realtime analytics and reporting for coding projects. With Nebulis you can embed an endpoint into your coding units so that you can gather code changes to a project fork. Nebulis is set up to be close to zero configuration, so as soon as the endpoint is launched on a fork, that user will be instantly registered into the system and attached to the associated project.

## Installation
---

```
npm install --save nebulis-endpoint
```
